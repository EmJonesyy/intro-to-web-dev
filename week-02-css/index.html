    <p> Betty White is one of my most favorite actresses of all time!</p>
    <p> She had such a positive outlook on life, and was an inspiration to so many!</p>
    <p> I thought it would be fun to share some quotes she had said over the years.</p>
    <p>"Everybody needs a passion. That’s what keeps life interesting. If you live without passion, you can go through life without leaving any footprints."</p>
    <p>"Don’t try to be young. Just open your mind. Stay interested in stuff. There are so many things I won’t live long enough to find out about, but I’m still curious about them."</p>
    <p>"Laughter keeps everyone feeling wonderful."</p>
    <p>"If one has no sense of humor, one is in trouble."</p>
    <p>"I know unless I’m true to myself I couldn’t be happy. Too much emphasis is placed today on externals and too little on character."</p>
